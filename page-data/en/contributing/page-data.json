The first hackathon will be at 5-9 July. If you want to take part, please see the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ueLpnCIA06f05uuSTop8DU9olLb0M34iR_HrjsebRfI/edit#slide=id.p\">onboarding and planning document for the hackathon</a>.</p>\n<h2>Be active on Github</h2>\n<p>Raise an issue, submit a pull request, etc. Be bold!

We're in this together. There's always stuff to do. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/demodam/demodam.org/projects/1\">Communications board</a> to see if there's anything you can help out with. Or add to it if you have a good idea.  </p>\n<h2>Publish Common Ground components to Demodam</h2>\n<p>Demodam is a showcase website for open source components. Please reach out to the Technical action team via Slack or Github if you want to publish your components on Demodam.</p>\n<h2>Take part in an action team</h2>\n<p>The Demodam codebase forms action teams to solve specific tasks. Each team has a team lead that is responsible for setting dates for meetings of the team and for (collaboratively) setting the agenda. The team lead is also a first point of contact for the team. </p>\n<p>These teams can make day to day decisions to move things forward, but cannot overrule decisions made by the steering team. Each action team must be represented in the steering group by at least one person (as a linking pin). Usually that person is the team lead. If a team cannot resolve an issue with consensus in the group, any participant of the group can raise the issue to the steering team. Action teams have the mandate to take action whenever they think it helps Demodam and work on an \"ask for forgiveness, not for permission\" basis for now. So be bold! And have fun ðŸ¦–. </p>\n<h3>Communications action team</h3>\n<p>Open group that works in a community style (there is likely to be a core team, that guides a wider community of participants and ambassadors).
