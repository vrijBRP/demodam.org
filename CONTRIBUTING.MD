## Take part in an action team

The Demodam codebase forms action teams to solve specific tasks. These can make day to day decisions to move things forward, but cannot overrule decisions made by the steering team. Each action team must be represented in the steering group by at least one person (as a linking pin). If a team cannot resolve an issue with consensus in the group, any participant of the group can raise the issue to the steering team. Action teams have the mandate to take action whenever they think it helps Demodam and work on an "ask for forgiveness, not for permission" basis for now.

### Communications action team

### Technical action team
    * Hosting setup
    * How can several competing products all get a place on Demodam? (technical aspects of that)
    * Advise (not decide) on acceptance criteria of components from a technical point of view (ie definition of done)
    * **Members**: Ruben van der Linden (team lead), Joeri
### User centricity action team
    * Advise (not decide) on acceptance criteria from a  user centered design point of view (ie definition of done)
    * Organize workshops before and during hackathons
    * Advise on the design of demodam.nl itself (how are the needs of different stakeholders met?). Guide the user centered design process to achieve this. 
    * **Members**: Under consideration (yet to be determined): Jeroen Vonk, Victor Zuydweg, Robbert, Edo Plantinga. If you want to be team lead for this team, please reach out to Edo.
