# Governance for Demodam

## Goals of Demodam

* **Showcase.** Demodam shows working digital services that municipalities (and possibly other governmental organisations) can re-use.
* **Collaborate.** On Demodam we learn how we collaborate in the Common Ground ecosystem. This happens both at a systems level (how do components interact?) and at a human level (how do we work together?).
* **Experiment.**
    * Improve governance for the Common Ground ecosystem.
* **Improve.** Set standards together: when do we say a component is ready for production?

## Principles

As a community we want to make it easier for new users to become contributors and maintainers.

The Demodam community adheres to the following principles:

* Demodam is open source
* Welcoming and respectful as mentioned in our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* Transparent and accessible, changes to the Demodam organization, Demodam code repositories, and Demodam related activities (e.g. level, involvement, etc.) are done in public
* Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles

The maintainers of Demodam have a steering team.

Through codebase stewardship the Foundation for Public Code supports the governance of Demodam, the steering team, and its community.

## Steering team

The Demodam steering team members are active contributors who are on a day-to-day basis responsible for:

* Handling code of conduct violations
* Overseeing the resolution and disclosure of security issues

If steering team members cannot reach consensus informally, the question at hand should be forwarded to the steering team meeting.

Any active member of the community can request to become a steering team member by asking the steering team. The steering team will vote on it (simple majority).

The current team members are:

* Edo Plantinga
* Ruben van der Linde
* Joeri Bekker
* Alba Roza

The steering team has the joint responsibility to:

* Maintaining the **mission, vision, values, and scope** of the project
* Serve as an **escalation level** for the action groups / working groups
    * Resolve escalated project decisions when a sub-team responsible is blocked
* Set and decide **technical constraints and standards** for the Demodam environment
* Provide **technical direction** for the codebase
* Maintain a technical **roadmap**, an **architecture** and **coding principles**
* **Resolve issues** in development or conflicts between contributors
* Manage and plan **releases**
* Control rights to Demodam assets such as source repositories
* Collecting planned features and presenting them in a unified view
* Refine the governance as needed
* Make codebase level decisions
* Manage the Demodam brand
* Oversee licensing and intellectual property changes
* Control access to Demodam assets such as hosting and project calendars

The steering team meets regularly. Their agenda includes review of the technical roadmap and issues that are at an impasse. The intention of the agenda is not to review or approve all patches. This is mainly being done through the process described in CONTRIBUTING.md. Meetings and their agenda should be announced on the [mailing list](https://lists.publiccode.net/mailman/postorius/lists/demodam-discuss.lists.publiccode.net/) and on [Slack](https://samenorganiseren.slack.com/archives/C01S2QM81V4).

No individual or organization will employ a simple majority of the steering team.

## Working groups and action groups

The Demodam codebase forms working and action groups to solve specific tasks. These can make day-to-day decisions to move things forward, but cannot overrule decisions made by the steering team. Each working or action group must be represented in the steering group by at least one person. If a group cannot resolve an issue with consensus in the group, any participant of the group can raise the issue to the steering team.

## Decision making process

The default decision making process is lazy-consensus. This means that any decision is considered supported by the team making it as long as no one objects. Silence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will.

When a consensus cannot be found a team member can call for a majority vote on a decision. Every team member has 1 vote, but each organization can be represented by only 1 team member in a vote regardless of how many members from their organization there are on the team.

Many of the day-to-day project maintenance tasks can be done by a lazy consensus model. But the following items must be called to vote:

* Adding a team member (simple majority)
* Removing a team member (simple majority)
* Changing the governance rules (this document) (simple majority)
* Licensing and intellectual property changes (including new logos, wordmarks) (simple majority)
* Adding, archiving, or removing sub-projects (simple majority)

Votes related to these items need to be communicated to the steering team and put on the agenda upfront with enough time prior to the meeting where the voting takes place. All decisions shall be documented in a version control system.

## Code of Conduct

Demodam's Code of Conduct is explained in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

If the possible violation involves a team member that member will be recused from voting on the issue.
